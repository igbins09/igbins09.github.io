- **Personal Touch**: The Nigerian flair ("Naija ingenuity," "Lagos traffic jam," "Naija teamwork") adds a unique voice, aligning with your earlier request for a Nigerian-inspired tone.
- **Achievements**: Included specific achievements from your resume (e.g., "30% efficiency improvement," "20% storage cost savings") to highlight impact.
- **URLs**: Placeholder URLs (e.g., `https://igbins09.github.io/cicd-demo/`) assume you’ve set up GitHub Pages for each project. Update these once deployed.
- **Image**: The placeholder image link (`https://via.placeholder.com/1200x600.png`) can be replaced with a real screenshot of your portfolio.
- **Setup**: Instructions are basic but functional for local testing; adjust if you use a different setup (e.g., Jekyll).
